# CocktailBar
## In this project we wanted to create a website that feeds the curiosity of cocktail lovers. 

Our aims were:
- Create a simple, aesthetically pleasing user interface.
- Provide instructions on how to make classic cocktails along with the ingredients needed via a simple serach.
- Provide the option of the user finding a bar around them.

We have learnt how to 
- Use GitHub collaboratively.
- Use APIs in a project and not reach their call limit.
- Add and troubleshoot animation.
- Dynamically create list items through trial and error. In the end we refactored the table through agile development.

Overall we developed our JavaScript, Bootstrap and Css skills further.
